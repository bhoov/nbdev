# Documentation Only Sites

> How to create nbdev powered docs without a library!
- order: 9

## Background

While nbdev is great for authoring software, you may wish to utilize the power of nbdev for the purposes of documenting existing code, or **use various utilities of nbdev without having to write a python library**. For example, you can use the following features of nbdev without creating a python package:

- Custom [nbdev directives](../explanations/directives.ipynb) such as [`#|hide_line`](../explanations/directives.ipynb#hide_line).
- Testing with `nbdev_test`.
- Automated entity linking with [doclinks](best_practices.ipynb#reference-related-symbols-with-doclinks).
- Rendering API documentation with [docments and show_doc](best_practices.ipynb#document-parameters-with-docments).

## Setup

To setup a documentation only site, you can follow these steps:

1. Create a nbdev repo the usual way, using `nbdev_new`
2. Remove library files

```bash
rm setup.py .github/workflows/test.yaml nbs/00_core.ipynb
```

3. Remove your library folder (this will be the `lib_path` field in `settings.ini`):

```bash
rm -rf <lib_path>
```

## Usage

After setting up your project, you can use various nbdev utilities per usual:

- `nbdev_preview` for previewing your site
- `nbdev_test` for testing your docs locally
- Custom [nbdev directives](../explanations/directives.ipynb) will be available to you (but you must be careful not to use irrelevant ones like `#|export`).
- If you created your nbdev docs site on GitHub, GitHub Actions will publish your docs for you automatically [as described here](../explanations/docs.ipynb#Deploying-Docs-With-GitHub-Actions).
- You can publish your docs on other platforms as described [here](../explanations/docs.ipynb#Deploying-Your-Docs-On-Other-Platforms).

## Demo

A minimal example of a documentation-only site is located [here](https://github.com/hamelsmu/nolib_nbdev).
