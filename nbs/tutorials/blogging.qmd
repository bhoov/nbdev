# Blogging

> Creating a blog with notebooks
- order: 5

## Background

Blogging with notebooks can offer a dramatic quality of life improvement over writing in Markdown, especially for blog posts that contain code.  Previously, there were no static site generators that supported Jupyter Notebooks as a first-class authoring medium.  This previously led us to create [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages) (now deprecated), which extended [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to enable blogging directly with Jupyter.  

## Enter Quarto

However, there now exists [Quarto](https://quarto.org/), a wonderful publishing system with rich support for authoring via Jupyter Notebooks.  

Some helpful resources on getting started with Quarto:

- [The Quarto Homepage](https://quarto.org/)
- [Creating A Blog With Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html): This page helps you get started with creating a blog.
- [A Gallery of Quarto Sites](https://quarto.org/docs/gallery/): Good reference examples of using Quarto.
- [The Quarto Website](https://github.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web): The Quarto website is built with Quarto and they use some of its advanced functionality.  It is instructive to look through this project to understand how Quarto works.

### You don't need nbdev to blog with notebooks

You do not need to use nbdev to create a blog with notebooks.  However, you may wish to:

- Incorporate a blog in your nbdev project's website
- Use some nbdev functionality in your blog (testing, exporting etc)

We will discuss these subjects in this article.

## Migrating from fastpages

If you previously had a fastpages site, we offer some utilities to help migrate you to Quarto.  **The migration is not holistic: you will likely have to manually correct some things that we are not able to automate.**

Instructions:

1. [Install Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/)
2. Create a new repo or directory to migrate your blog to

3. In this new repo, create a quarto blog and install required extensions with the following terminal commands. This will create a minimal project structure for you:

```bash
quarto create-project --type website:blog .
quarto install extension quarto-ext/video
```

5. Your new repo will have a `posts/` directory.  This is where you will copy all of your notebook and markdown posts from fastpages.  For example, let's say your fastpages blog repo is in a sibling directory located at `../blog/`, you would copy all the relevant posts like this: 

:::{.callout-important}

Make sure you are in root of your quarto directory before executing the below commands.  Furthermore, change the commands as appropriate depending on the location of your fastpages repo relative to your current directory.

:::

```bash
cp -r ../blog/_notebooks/* posts
cp -r ../blog/_posts/* posts
```

6. Copy all images associated with your posts into the `posts/` directory. We have to get our images from several places (due to the way Jekyll and fastpages work):

```bash
cp ../blog/images/* posts
cp -r ../blog/images/copied_from_nb/* posts/
```

7. Make your posts Quarto compatible with the following command:

```bash
nbdev_migrate --path posts
```

:::{.callout-note collapse="true"}

### What does `nbdev_migrate` do?

`nbdev_migrate` does the following things:

#### For notebooks
- Migrates markdown front matter to raw cell front matter [as described here](../api/migrate.ipynb#migrateproc).
- nbdev v1 directives are automatically converted to [Quarto directives](../explanations/directives.ipynb).  Note that we convert everything to Quarto directives (nbdev-specific directives are not relevant for this context)
- Markdown shortcut for embedding youtube videos and callouts are automatically converted to work with Quarto.

#### For markdown and notebooks
- Automatically creates [link aliases](https://quarto.org/docs/reference/formats/html.html#website) so that old links will not break.  Jekyll automatically generates URLs differently than Quarto, so this ensures that the Jekyll way is aliased.
- Automatically corrects image paths
- Makes front matter compatible with Quarto by changing field names and values where necessary

:::

8. Update the following files: 
    
- `./.gitignore`: we suggest adding`_site/` as well as dot files `.*`
- `./about.qmd`: Add some information about yourself.
- `./profile.jpg`: optionally change the profile picture.

9. Preview your site with the command `quarto preview`, and make any necessary adjustments and fix for broken links or Jekyll shortcodes (things with `{% ... %}`) that need to be converted to Quarto.  Search the [the Quarto documentation](https://quarto.org/) if you need help locating specific Quarto features.

### Configuration options: fastpages vs. Quarto

fastpages (which is based on Jekyll) and Quarto offer different options and configurations for individual posts and at a site level.  The tables below enumerate some of the most important features of fastpages and how they map to Quarto.  Each link in the last column is specific to the relevant feature.

## Publishing your blog

::: {.callout-warning}
_This section is for stand-alone blogs that are not part of a nbdev documentation site.  If you want to create a blog within a nbdev documentation site, see [this section](#creating-a-blog-within-a-nbdev-project)._
:::

You can publish your site with the `quarto publish` command. See [the docs](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/) for more details.  

:::{.callout-note}

### GitHub Pages

If using GitHub Pages, commit your files to GitHub before publish your site.  **No GitHub Actions are needed**, you can use `quarto publish` instead.  If you want to automate your workflow with GitHub Actions, you can follow [these instructions](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/quarto-pub.html#github-action) 

:::


## Creating a blog within a nbdev project

In addition to a stand-alone blog that you might build with Quarto, you might want to include a blogging site in your nbdev project. This website has [a blog](../blog/) as well!  The easiest way to implement a blog is to emulate the directory structure of [this folder](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev/tree/master/nbs/blog).  The general steps are:

1. **Create a `blog/` directory in your notebooks folder.**
2. **Create a `index.qmd` file in the root of the `blog/` directory.**  Here [is an example](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev/blob/master/nbs/blog/index.qmd).


The frontmatter the `index.qmd` file signals to Quarto that you intend to create a blog.  For example, here is [our front matter](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev/blob/master/nbs/blog/index.qmd):

```yaml
---
title: nbdev Blog
subtitle: News, tips, and commentary about all things nbdev
listing:
  sort: "date desc"
  contents: "posts"
  sort-ui: false
  filter-ui: false
  categories: true
  feed: true
page-layout: full
---
```

The `listing:` field specifies how you want to structure your blog.  Feel free to copy ours as-is, but we encourage you to [consult the documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) for additional options.

3. **Create a link to your blog on your site's navbar so people can find it**: To add a link to your blog on your site's navbar, you must edit the navbar section of `_quarto.yml` to include a link to your blog's listing page, which is `blog/index.qmd` in our example.  For nbdev, the relevant part of our [`_quarto.yml`](https://github.com/fastai/nbdev/blob/master/nbs/_quarto.yml) file looks like this:
[The yaml snippet shown below is an abbreviated version of nbdev's [`_quarto.yml`](# An abbreviated version of https://github.com/fastai/nbdev/blob/master/nbs/_quarto.yml) file.]{.aside}
```yaml
website:
  navbar:
    left:
      - text: "Blog"
        href: blog/index.qmd
```


You can read more about the navbar in the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-navigation.html#top-navigation).

4. **Create a folder for each blog post**: This is not strictly required, but we recommend this as a way to keep your blog posts and related assets (pictures, videos etc) organized.  

5. **Create your first blog post**: You can emulate our example or create your own.  In each folder, create a `index.qmd` or `index.ipynb` file.  You can also put images and related assets in the same folder.


### Folder structure

Below is an overview of the general folder structure for a blog within a nbdev site:

```
nbs/blog
├── index.qmd
└── posts
    ├── 2022-07-28-nbdev2
    │   ├── cover.png
    │   ├── index.qmd
    │   ├── ...
    └── 2022-08-25-jupyter-git
        ├── friendly-conflict.png
        ├── index.qmd
        └── ...
    ...
```

- `nbs/blog`: this is the folder inside your notebook folder that contains the blog.
- `index.qmd`: this is at the root of your blog folder and is the listings page for your blog.
- `posts/`: this a subdirectory for each blog post.
- `YYYY-MM-DD-.../index.{qmd,ipynb}`: this is where you author the content of each individual blog post.

### Special considerations for nbdev blogs

In contrast to standalone Quarto blogs, when you embed a blog in a nbdev website there are the following differences:

- You can use all [nbdev directives](../explanations/directives.ipynb) in addition to Quarto ones.  All nbdev features will be available in your nbdev blog in the same way they work for other pages.
- Your site will automatically deploy with GitHub Actions or whatever deployment mechanism you have for your nbdev site, so you do not have to use `quarto publish`. 

## Using nbdev features in blogs outside nbdev projects

::: {.callout-warning}
_This section is for stand-alone blogs that are not part of a nbdev documentation site.  If you create a blog within a nbdev documentation site, all nbdev features will automatically work._
:::
    
If you create a standalone blog with Quarto, a limited number of nbdev features can still assist you.  For example, we recommend installing [Jupyter git hooks](pre_commit.ipynb).  A list of nbdev features available to you are listed in [this article](modular_nbdev.ipynb).

## Creating A New Blog Site From Scratch

You can use the [quarto CLI](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) to setup a new blog project called `myblog` with the following command:

```bash
quarto create-project myblog --type website:blog
```

You can then preview your blog project with `quarto preview`.  You can also publish your blog using the [`quarto publish`](https://quarto.org/docs/publishing/quarto-pub.html#publish-command) command.  

:::{.callout-tip}

### Adding a notebook blog post

To add a notebook blog post to a blog project created with the above commands, you can add an additional folder under `posts/` and name the notebook `index.ipynb`.  You will see existing example blog posts that are `index.qmd` files in sibling folders you can look at for examples.  You will need to add [yaml front matter](https://quarto.org/docs/tools/jupyter-lab.html#yaml-front-matter) to the first cell of your notebook in the form of a raw cell.

# FAQ

1. **Do I need to migrate from fastpages?**  

    No you do not.  However we will not be actively supporting fastpages going forward.

2. **Will migrating from fastpages to Quarto take lots of manual effort?**

    You will have to do some manual work to make sure everything looks and works the same, including converting Jekyll shortcodes to equivalent Quarto commands.  However, we have automated the biggest aspects for you. Please see [Migrating from fastpages](#migrating-from-fastpages) for instructions.

3. **I cannot find something in Quarto that does what `#collapse_output` did in fastpages**

    Correct, this is a feature that isn't supported in Quarto yet.  

4. **Why am I seeing `{% twitter ...%}` and `{% fn_detail ... %}` and other `{%...%}` commands in my Quarto blog posts?**

    These are Jekyll shortcodes that you will have to manually migrate to Quarto.  For example with the twitter embeds, you can insert the appropriate HTML as [recommended by Twitter](https://help.twitter.com/en/using-twitter/how-to-embed-a-tweet#:~:text=Click%20the%20icon%20located%20within,by%20clicking%20set%20customization%20options).  For footnotes, you can see [these docs](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/footnotes-and-citations.html).  For other items, you should search the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) for how to enable your desired result.
    
5. **I created a new blog post and used `#| hide` but the cell is still showing.  What is wrong?**

    You must use Quarto directives, not nbdev-specific ones.  See the difference between the two [in these docs](../explanations/directives.ipynb).  This is because you are blogging with Quarto, not nbdev.  The exception to this is you have a blog site in your nbdev project -- in that case, nbdev-specific directives will work. 
    
6.  **How do I enable comments on my blog posts?**

    In general, Quarto offers all of the same features and much more than fastpages did, including comments.  If you search the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/) for comments, you will see a [page for enabling comments](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/html-basics.html#commenting).
    
7.  **How do I sort and hide posts?  What about the publishing date since that's not in the filename?**

    See the Quarto docs on [creating a blog](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html) as well as [listing pages](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-listings.html).
    
8.  **How do I customize my site?**

    See the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html)

9. **How do I do set up RSS Feeds and add particular features to my site?**

    See the [Quarto docs](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-blog.html)
    
8. **What does nbdev have to do with Quarto?**.

    For just blogging, nothing!  You can use Quarto for blogging without worrying about nbdev.  In the past, we maintained a nbdev related project called [fastpages](https://github.com/fastai/fastpages), and are recommending that people migrate to Quarto if possible.  Furthermore, nbdev is built on top of Quarto which means much of the functionality is similar.  Finally, you can incorporate blogs into a nbdev project site, which we discuss in [this section](#creating-a-blog-within-a-nbdev-project).
    
9. **For stand alone blogs, why are you directing us to Quarto, can I just use nbdev?**

    nbdev is built on top of Quarto. For the purposes of blogging, adding nbdev is of little additional benefit if all you want to do is to blog.  We decided to keep things simple and let people use Quarto directly instead of trying to abstract aspects of Quarto for blogging.  Furthermore, having some knowledge of Quarto can be very helpful in using nbdev!.  Lastly, you can still use some nbdev features in your blog, which are listed in [this article](modular_nbdev.ipynb).
